## Project: The Great Detective
The Great Detective is an interactive murder-mystery game.


### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to change narrative number of lines
  - What it does: Allows user to change the number of lines to be printed each time during story-telling narrative at the start of each scene.
  - Justification: As the narrative of each scene can be quite long, printing the entire narrative at once could overflow the terminal / command line.
  This feature allows user to easily pace themselves and view the narrative better.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to restart the game
  - What it does: Allows user to restart the game back to the beginning, either in the middle of the game or after choosing the correct / wrong suspect at the end of the game.
  - Justification: After the game end, the user will receive a prompt to restart the game.
  Also, anytime during the game, the user can discard their progress and restart back to the beginning to start over.

- **New Feature**: Suspect class
  - What it does: Contains the list of clues for the different suspects.
  - Justification: It allows us to manage the different suspects as each suspect has a different list of clues.

- **New Feature**: SuspectList class
  - What it does: Contains the list of suspects for the different scene.
  - Justification: It allows us to manage each scene with different suspect list.

- **New Feature**: Investigation class
  - What it does: Manages the investigation in each investigation scene based on the current state of the game (Suspect or Clue stage)
  - Justification: It allows us to handle the commands from the user and contains the main flow of the game.
